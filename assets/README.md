# password-generator 

In this project I created a random password generator. It allows the user to customize what kind of random generated password they would like. You have options to choose from having special characters, and numbers to uppercase and lowercase letters. After the user confirms/denies which different types of characters they want to include in their password it will generate a random password. 

With security being very important to every user and to me as the developer, I wanted to create a more secure password generator for users. 

In this project I learned the importance of for loops, prompts, and functions.
